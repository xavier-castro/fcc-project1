# Building a Tribute Page

Main objective is creating a tribute page with vanilla html and css only. This is the first project from freecodecamp.org

## Instructions

1. Page should have an `id="main"`, which contains all other elements

2. There should be an `id="title"` which contains a string that describes the subject of the tribute page

3. There should be an `id="img-div"`

4. Within the `img-div` element, there should be an `img` element with a corresponding `id="image"`

5. Within the `img-div` element, there should be an `id="img-caption"` that contains textual consent describing the image shown in `img-div`

6. There should be an `id="tribute-info"` which contains textual content describing the subject of the tribute page

7. There should be `a` element with a corresponding `id="tribute-link"` that links to an outside site that contains additional information about the subject of the tribute page. You must give your element an attribute of `target` and set it to `_blank` in order for your link to open in a new tab (`target="_blank"`)

8. The `img` element should responsively resize, relative to the width of its parent element, without exceeding its original size

9. The `img` element should be centerd within its parent element

10. Upload the html and css to codepen.io
